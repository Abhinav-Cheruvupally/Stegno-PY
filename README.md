# Steganography
***Hide text messages in images***
## Description
(**TL;DR :**   *This program can hide a text message in an image, which can only be decoded by this program only.*)     

Steganography can be divided into two types:
  1. Spatial domain transformation:  
      - **LSB** (Least Significant Bit) transformation.
  2. Frequemcy domain transformation:  
      - **DCT** (Discrete Cosine Transformation).
      - **DWT** (Discrete Wavelet Transformation).  

We are using LSB to hide the text in Image 

To run this program hit main.py

this program includes encryption and decryption of image through enumeration 

Steps before running the program

Keys.txt is availabe to add your own key to encrypt and decrypt the range of key should be 0-255

Run the program
Select Encode 
then type one of the picture name present in Orginal_image and write down the secret message
Type full image name with extension
Then it will encrypt using the key u saved in keys.txt
It will ask  for Sending Email write down your email in the program before and program asks to send to the email 

Then terminate the program and remember to make sure u are existing user and then download the image paste in the folder encoded and then decode it you will see your text message
